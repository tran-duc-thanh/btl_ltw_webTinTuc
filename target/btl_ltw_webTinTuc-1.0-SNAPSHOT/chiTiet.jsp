            <h2>'Double Mutant' Coronavirus Variant Detected in San Francisco</h2>
            <br>
            <h3>The variant, which is driving a spike in India but had not been seen in the U.S., is referred to as a
                ‘double mutant’ because it carries two mutations that help the virus attach to cells.</h3>

                <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2021-04-05/double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-detected-in-san-francisco">Original
                    Article</a></h4>
            <p>A NEW "DOUBLE MUTANT" strain of the coronavirus has been discovered in San Francisco, marking the first
                time the variant, thought to be behind a surge of cases in India, has been identified in the United
                States.</p>

            <p>The mutation is referred to as a "double mutant" because it carries two mutations that help the virus
                attach to cells, The San Francisco Chronicle <a
                        href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/Double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-surfaces-16076361.php">reported</a>.
            </p>

            <p>The Stanford Clinical Virology Lab identified and confirmed one case of the variant that originated in
                India.</p>

            <p>The case is a patient from a Stanford Health Care clinic and likely occurred in Santa Clara County,
                according to the Chronicle. County health officials said they are not monitoring the new variant because
                it isn't on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of concern, according to the
                Chronicle.</p>

            <p>One of the mutations in the new strain is similar to that found on both the variants first detected in
                Brazil and South Africa. The second mutation has been found in a variant in California. The mutation is
                believed to be more transmissible than the original strain of COVID-19, but it is not yet known if it is
                more resistant to vaccines.</p>

            <p>Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at the University of California San Francisco, told the
                Chronicle that the variant is the first time two mutations have been detected in the same virus.</p>

            <p>"This Indian variant contains two mutations in the same virus for the first time, previously seen on
                separate variants," Chin-Hong said. "Since we know that the domain affected is the part that the virus
                uses to enter the body, and that the California variant is already potentially more resistant to some
                vaccine antibodies, it seems to reason that there is a chance that the Indian variant may do that
                too."</p>

            <p>Initial results from trials conducted with vaccines currently approved for use in the U.S. have shown
                that vaccines are still effective against variants, and Chin-Hong said he was "optimistic" that they
                would also be effective against the "double mutant" strain as well.</p>
